1: Merge Sort  ::Date:11/06/2021<br>
<h3>Merge Sort:</h3>
First divide the list into the smallest unit (1 element), then compare each element with the adjacent list to sort and merge the two adjacent lists. Finally all the elements are sorted and merged. ... Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.
TC=O(nlogn) in all cases.

2:Insertation Sort ::Date:13/06/2021<br>
<h3>Insertion Sort:</h3>
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
<h4>Algorithm </h4>
To sort an array of size n in ascending order:<br> 
1: Iterate from arr[1] to arr[n] over the array. <br>
2: Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor.<br> 
3: If the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before. Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.<br>
TC=O(n) Best case.<br>
TC=O(n^2) Average case.

6:Anagram  ::19/06/2021<br>
<h3>What is Anagram?</h3>
Two words are anagrams of each other if they contain the same number of characters and the same characters. You should only need to sort the characters in lexicographic order, and determine if all the characters in one string are equal to and in the same order as all of the characters in the other string.
Example::"keep" and "peek".
