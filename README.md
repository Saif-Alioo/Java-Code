1: Merge Sort  ::Date:11/06/2021<br>
<h3>Merge Sort:</h3>
First divide the list into the smallest unit (1 element), then compare each element with the adjacent list to sort and merge the two adjacent lists. Finally all the elements are sorted and merged. ... Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.
TC=O(nlogn) in all cases.

2:Insertation Sort ::Date:13/06/2021<br>
<h3>Insertion Sort:</h3>
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
<h4>Algorithm </h4>
To sort an array of size n in ascending order:<br> 
1: Iterate from arr[1] to arr[n] over the array. <br>
2: Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor.<br> 
3: If the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before. Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.<br>
TC=O(n) Best case.<br>
TC=O(n^2) Average case.

3:Count Sort  ::Date:15/06/2021<br>
<h3>Count Sort</h3>
Counting Sort Algorithm is an efficient sorting algorithm that can be used for sorting elements within a specific range. This sorting technique is based on the frequency/count of each element to be sorted.
Let's talk about time complexity
<h4>Time Complexity:</h4>
O(n+k) where n is the number of elements in input array and k is the range of input. 
<h4>Auxiliary Space:</h4> O(n+k)

4:LongestCommonPrifix  ::Date:16/06/2021<br>
<h3>LongestCommonPrifix:</h3>
The longest common prefix for an array of strings is the common prefix between 2 most dissimilar strings. For example, in the given array {“apple”, “ape”, “zebra”}, there is no common prefix because the 2 most dissimilar strings of the array “ape” and “zebra” do not share any starting characters.

6:Anagram  ::19/06/2021<br>
<h3>What is Anagram?</h3>
Two words are anagrams of each other if they contain the same number of characters and the same characters. You should only need to sort the characters in lexicographic order, and determine if all the characters in one string are equal to and in the same order as all of the characters in the other string.
Example::"keep" and "peek".

8: Find Pivote ::09/07/2021 
<h3>Problem ?</h3>
Given an array of integers nums, calculate the pivot index of this array.
The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.
If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is 0 because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.
Return the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return -1.
